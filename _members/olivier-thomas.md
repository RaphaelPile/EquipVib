Olivier Thomas received the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from École Normale Supérieure de Cachan, Cachan, France, and the Ph.D. degree from Pierre et Marie Curie University of Paris, Paris, France, and Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France, in 2001. He spent nine years in Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, Paris, as an Assistant Professor and he has been a Full Professor in mechanical engineering at Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology, Lille, France, since 2012. He is the Head of a research group of 2 assistant professors and 6 Ph.D. candidates/postdoctorates.

His research topics focus on:
- Nonlinear dynamics and vibrations of mechanical systems and structures. Geometrical nonlinearities.
- Modelling, experiments and numerical methods for linear and nonlinear structural dynamics
- Nonlinear model reduction. Nonlinear modes.
- Smart electromechanical systems (piezoelectric and electromagnetic coupling)
- Applications to vibration absorbers: mechanical (tuned mass dampers) or electromechanical shunts (resistive, resonant, negative capacitance)
- Applications to micro/nano electromechanical systems
- Applications to nonlinear percussion musical instruments: gongs, cymbals, steel-pans
